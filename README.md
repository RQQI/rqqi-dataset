# RQQI Submitted Dataset Repository

This repository contains datasets submitted for use within the WMO Radar
Quality Control and Quantitative Precipitation Estimation project also
known as RQQI.

## How to download this dataset

The radar scan files contained in this repository are managed using `git-lfs`.
`git-lfs` is an extension to `git` which allows large binary files to be
stored and version controlled within a git repository in much the same way that
source code and other text files can be.

To correctly clone (ie: download) the dataset you will need to have `git-lfs`
installed.  To install `git-lfs` simply:
- Navigate to http://git-lfs.github.com and click _Download_
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Run `install.sh`
- Run the command `git lfs install`

With `git-lfs` installed, to download the entire dataset simply clone the
repository:

    git clone https://github.com/RQQI/rqqi-datasets
